# 🚀 Scarmonit Development Guide

Your environment is fully active. Here is how to **start using** your new capabilities.

## 🌐 Web Portal (Running)
*   **URL:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
*   **Status:** ✅ Online
*   **Action:** Use Copilot to modify the frontend.
    *   *"Analyze `web-portal/src/App.tsx` and suggest UI improvements."*

## 🛠️ MCP Tool Actions

### 1. 🧠 Self-Improvement (Refactor Code)
The engine has already found issues in your MCP server. Fix them now:
> **Prompt:** "Read the analysis report in `src/servers/data/improvements/` and generate a fix for the error handling issues in `mcp-server`."

### 2. 🏗️ DevOps (Deploy)
Ready to ship? Generate the deployment assets:
> **Prompt:** "Generate a Dockerfile for the `web-portal` application using `node:20-alpine`."

### 3. ☁️ Architecture (Query)
Need to understand the system?
> **Prompt:** "Use `query_docs` to explain the data flow between the Web Portal and the API."

---
**Pro Tip:** You can chain these!
> "Analyze `web-portal/package.json` to check for security issues, then generate a GitHub Actions workflow to build it."
